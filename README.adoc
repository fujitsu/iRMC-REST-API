== Introduction
Base Management Controllers are components of x86 servers that allow out-of-band management of hardware. The implementation used by
Fujitsu is called Integrated Remote Management Controller (hereinafter referred to as iRMC). All of these management controllers have a web
interface for interactive operation. iRMC also allows automated operation via a RESTful API from the S4 generation onwards <<API>>. The scripts
described here use this API for profile management, custom image management, operating system deployment and various help functions.

The programs and tools described here are not official Fujitsu software components. They are only an example implementation of the official
RESTful API Specification <<API>> and the descriptions of the Profile Specification <<ProfileSpec>>.

WARNING: The use is therefore at your own risk and without any guarantee! +
Please also note the hints in chapter "Reboot behaviour"! 

== Requirements

=== Hardware

On the hardware side, an iRMC of generation S4 or higher is required on which the RESTful protocol is available and enabled.
The user used for authentication must have the permission <<GUI>> to use the RESTful API <<API>> order. From iRMC Generation S5 on, this is already the
delivery status. For the S4 generation the following screenshot shows the necessary settings:


image::EditLocalUserAccount.png[alt=iRMC: Edit local user account,align=center]


The examples shown here were performed on a PRIMERGY RX2540 M4 with iRMC version 1.25P and BIOS version R1.22.0 to iRMC version 2.6x
and BIOS version R1.4x, and on a PRIMERGY RX2540 M5 with iRMC version 2.63P and BIOS version R1.19.0.
In addition, the eLCM (embedded Lifecycle Management) license is required to use the Custom Image and OS Deployment functions

=== Software
On the software side, the free tool https://curl.se/[cURL] is necessary, which handles the data transfer between program and iRMC via RESTful API <<API>> done. The
scripts described here are BASH scripts and can therefore be used natively under all UNIX/Linux environments. For use under Windows, its Linux
subsystem can be used. Alternatively, other tools like https://cygwin.com/[Cygwin] are also suitable

== Installation
If you've `git` you simply install this tool by `git clone https://github.com/fujitsu/iRMC-REST-API`. Afterwards the tools is located in directory `iRMC-REST-API`. Please extend your PATH var to this directory.

This data can be adapted to your own environment to save you typing work. This script is not called directly by the user. However, almost all parameters can be passed via command line parameters of the respective user commands, which then override these
defaults.

* `resttool` +
This contains various library routines. This script is therefore only included by other scripts and is not directly executed by the user.

* `rest* (e.g., restgetprofile/restuploadci/restdeployos/restgetmac/restresetirmc/...)` +
These scripts that can be called by the user are described in the corresponding chapters. It may be advisable to set the PATH variable
to include the directory where these tools were unpacked. In general, an online help of possible parameters can be displayed for all
commands via the switch "-h". See also the example below.

WARNING: Please consider the <<security>> regarding using user name and password as commandline parameters.


* `example` +
Directory with a sample CSV file containing some server info. 


* `download server` +
Directory with sample XML files for the configuration of the download server.


* `deploy` +

----
This help function can be applied to all scripts. If individual switches are not specified, the default settings of the file restoptions are used. The
default settings are shown in round brackets.

== Monitoring
Some functions that are called via the RESTful API are asynchronous in the background. This basically concerns all operations that may take longer, such as uploading an image with many megabytes of data. For this purpose iRMC-internal "sessions" are created. These sessions can be tracked in the iRMC (from FW version 2.20) in the "Task Manager":

image::TaskManager1.png[alt=iRMC: Task Manager 1,align=center]

image::TaskManager2.png[alt=iRMC: Task Manager 2,align=center]

== Profile Management

=== General operation
The different profile settings <<ProfileSpec>> are stored in a tree structure. There is one for the BIOS and one for the iRMC. These profiles can be read and written completely (e.g. IrmcConfig) or partially (e.g. IrmcConfig/System/AssetTag).

=== Download
The settings (profiles) stored in the BIOS or the iRMC can or must first be copied to an iRMC-internal buffer (store) before the actual download. The store must not yet contain a profile with the same name! This copying process is performed asynchronously in one session. Therefore you have to wait until this session is terminated. Afterwards, they can be transferred from this store to the computer of the calling CLI program.
All these steps are done by the `restgetprofile` script.

=== Upload
The upload takes place without a detour via a buffer (store) but also asynchronously, so that the end of the session must be waited for. The process can therefore take a few seconds.
The upload is done using the script `restsetprofile`.

=== General procedure
For an automated profile change, it should first be ensured that all affected servers are of the same type and have the same BIOS/iRMC-FW versions, since different versions may also have different parameters added or removed. Once a "master profile" has been read out via `restgetprofile`, it can be adapted according to your requirements and distributed to all servers of the same type with `restsetprofile`.

=== Reboot behaviour
IMPORTANT: *#Depending on the iRMC settings, a reboot is triggered already when reading BIOS profile settings! To prevent this, the iRMC setting "Enable Automatic BIOS Parameter Backup" must be activated:#*


image::ABPR.png[alt=iRMC: Enable Automatic BIOS Parameter Backup,align=center]

If this setting is activated, then a writing of BIOS-settings without immediate reboot can optionally be performed. This is enabled by the "-n" (noreboot) option in the `restsetprofile` command. The BIOS changes are of course only active after the next reboot of the server.

This option is not required for changes to iRMC settings. There is no server reboot during reading or writing and changes are effective immediately.

=== Profile Management Scripts
* `restgetprofile profiles` +
This script reads a profile from the iRMC (iRMC- or BIOS-Settings) starting with the level IrmcConfig or BiosConfig according to chapter 5 <<API>>. A call with the switch -h returns a short Usage.

* `restset profiles` +
This script transfers a profile from a file to the iRMC (iRMC or BIOS settings). A call with switch -h returns a short Usage.

* `chasset` +
A script to directly modify the asset tag. It uses the command `restsetprofile`. + 
Example call: `chasset InvNo 47110815` +
+
Since this simple script changes the asset tag string via sed, special characters such as "/" may have to be quoted accordingly, i.e. "/" must be changed to "\\/".

=== Example session
This example shows how to configure a separate NTP server for the iRMC.
It is recommended to make a backup of all settings first

IMPORTANT: *#Please read the notes about reboot behavior!#*

== Custom Image Handling
The iRMC, in conjunction with licensed eLCM, is able to boot bootable images that have been uploaded to the internal SD card. This makes it possible, for example, to start ISO images created by Content Collector/Update DVD with updates fully automatically and to update the system accordingly.

IMPORTANT: *The following instructions are mandotry for Custom Image Handling!*

* Uploading an image requires an http or https URL with the boot image as source. 
* The image file **must** have the extension `.iso.` 
* Booting a custom image performs an **immediate reset of the server**. So you should make sure that the server was either turned off or booted into the BIOS before. The latter can also be done automatically via IPMI. 
** Switch on the BIOS via IPMI One-Boot (`ipmitool [options...] chassis bootparam set bootflag force_bios`).  
** OS reboot (ssh/WMI)


* `restuploadci [<Image_URL>]` +
This script loads an image file to the internal SD card of the eLCM. If no switches for iRMC name/IP address, User, Password, Image_URL are given, the script uses default values of the file `restoptions`. If URL path or extension are omitted, they are automatically supplemented with the default settings from `restoptions`. The upload takes about 5 to 30 minutes depending on the image size. Please note that both the total size (~8GB) for images on the SD card and the number (7) of possible images are limited.

* `restlistci` +
This script lists the already existing images on the internal SD card. If no switches for iRMC name/IP address, user, password are given, the script uses default values of the file `restoptions`.

* `restdeleteci [<ImageName>]` +
This script deletes the specified image on the internal SD card. If no switches for iRMC name/IP address, user, password are given, the script uses default values of the file `restoptions`.

* `restbootci [<ImageName>]` +
This script boots the specified image. #A possibly running OS will be reset immediately!# If no switches for iRMC name/IP address, user, password are given, the script uses default values of the file `restoptions`.

=== Example session
Default values of the file `restoptions`. Can/should be adjusted accordingly.

== OS Deploy
In conjunction with licensed eLCM, the iRMC is able to install (deploy) operating systems supported by the embedded Installation Manager (eIM) and to configure them extensively (network, user, disk, local settings, ...). The operating system image to be installed is made available to the iRMC via an http(s) URL. Configuration parameters are stored in a separate, local JSON file for <<ProfileSpec>> deposit. Furthermore, access to a web download server for installation tool SVIM is required. This server is either provided on the Internet by Fujitsu or by using the Fujitsu Repository Server on the local customer network, which is practically a mirror of the Fujitsu server.

Management of the web download server:

* `restgetdeploy` +
This script lists the current configuration of the iRMC regarding the web download server in JSON format. +

[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ restgetdeploy 
2020-08-13 07:47:50 -- Reading Web download server settings on 10.172.124.225 ...

        "Server":{ 
            "URL": "https://webdownloads.ts.fujitsu.com", 
            "UseProxy": "yes" 
        }, 
        "Proxy":{ 
            "URL":"172.25.161.100", 
            "Port": "81", 
    "User":"(zero)" 
            "Password": "*****" 
        } 
    } 
}
----

* `restsetdeploy <deploy-config.xml>` +
This script adjusts the settings (URL/Proxy) of the web download server according to the entries in the **XML file**. The tarball contains sample configs in the subdirectory `./downloadserver`.
If you use your own repository server, make sure that the option `RepositoryMode` has the value 1 (=eIM repository only) or 2 (=globalflash and eIM repository). This parameter is set in the file `/opt/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/RepServer/cfg/RepServer.conf`


The download server settings can also be made in the iRMC GUI in the Settings/Service area:

image::DeploymentRepository.png[alt=iRMC: Configuring deployment repository access,align=center]

Loading the OS catalog:

* `restlistos` +
This script updates the list of supported operating systems by updating and displaying the catalog from the web download server. The displayed index value for a specific OS is needed in the next step.

Update of the eIM:

* `restloadeim <OSTypeId>` +
This script copies the current embedded Installation Manager (eIM) to the SD card of the eLCM, if a current version is not already available. Depending on the network speed, an upload can take much longer than one hour.

Installing the operating system:

* `restdeployos <OS-config.json>` +
This script installs the operating system defined in the specified JSON file according to the + config parameters also stored. The URL for the OS image is also stored in this JSON file. +
+
WARNING: #*Calling this script will reset the server immediately!*# +
+
The syntax for the JSON file is described in the manual "Profile Specification <<ProfileSpec>> documented. The URL for the OS mentioned in the JSON file must contain an unpacked ISO:

== Other Tools
The toolset also contains the following tools:
* `restresetirmc` +
Reboot the iRMC. The process can be aborted within 10 seconds (or in `restoptions` according to RESETWAITTIME) by SIGINT (Ctrl-C). The server must not be in the BIOS.

* `restgetmac` +
Lists the MAC addresses of all NICs. The server must be powered on and have either the Fujitsu Custom ESXi image or a Windows/Linux OS with ServerView Agents installed.

* `restgetbootmac [<onboard|lom> [<port>]]` +
Lists the MAC address of the specified port. Default is lom 1, the ports are counted starting from 1. No plausibility checks are performed! The same requirements apply as for `restgetmac`.

* `restgetversion` +
Lists the various Rest-Profile versions. This is needed, among other things, to check the plausibility of JSON files with config data for profile management.

== Security concerns
Even if it is possible to enter user names and passwords via commandline parameters to all commands: This should be used only in non critical environments (e.g. for testing). Otherwise this data could be read by any other user (e.g. by `ps -ef`).

The preferred and secure way to provide those critical data to the scripts is by defining those data in either `restoptions` file, in your `~/.profile` (or `~/.bash_profile`) file or by exporting vars in your shell (e.g. `export IRMC_CRED=_admin:mysecretpassword`).

WARNING: And of course, those files should be readable only by their owner (e.g. `chmod go-rwx restoptions ~/.profile`)!
